Therapist: [Warm, inviting tone] Hi, David. I’m glad you could make it today. I understand that the incident with burning food has stirred up some intense feelings of inadequacy. I'd love to hear more about what's been going on for you.
Client: [Rolls eyes slightly] Yeah, well, not much to say. Messed up some food, and now I'm a hopeless cook. Seems pretty clear-cut.
Therapist: [Nods calmly, offering reassurance] It sounds like this incident has really shaken your self-confidence in cooking. But I'm curious—when you think about that moment, does any other thought or feeling come to mind?
Client: [Dismissive shrug] What’s there to think about? Burned food means I'm just bad at it. Simple as that.
Therapist: [Smiling gently] I hear that you're feeling certain about being "bad" at cooking because of this mistake. Do you mind if we explore what makes this feel so definitive for you?
Client: [Arms crossed tightly] What's there to explore? It’s not like I’m imagining things—it happened.
Therapist: [Acknowledges with empathy] Absolutely, it did happen. And mistakes are real and sometimes frustrating. Yet I'm wondering if this one incident holds power over how you're defining yourself as a cook entirely.
Client: [Slight frown, looks away briefly] Maybe...I don't know. Feels like each time it's just confirming I'm no good at it.
Therapist: [Nods understandingly] It's understandable to feel that way when things don't go as planned repeatedly—it can chip away at our confidence over time. But perhaps we could look at those times when things have gone right in the kitchen too? Just to see both sides of the picture?
Client: [Looks skeptical] Right times? You mean like when I didn’t burn something?
Therapist: [Encouraging tone] Exactly—like any time you've prepared a meal or recipe and it turned out well or even just okay. These moments can offer a fuller view beyond the mistakes themselves.
Client: [Pauses thoughtfully before responding with partial agreement] Maybe...I guess there've been a few meals that weren’t disasters.
Therapist: [Smiles warmly, encouraging progress] That’s great to hear! Recognizing those experiences is important because they show us there's more than one story here—that skills vary day by day and can improve with practice.
Client: [Nods slowly, less tense but still hesitant] Hmm...might be true sometimes—I guess so...
Therapist: [Gently reflecting his words back with warmth] You mentioned "sometimes," which suggests there's room for different outcomes beyond burning food every time—and maybe even opportunities for growth within cooking itself? 
Client: [Appearing thoughtful but still reserved in expression] Maybe—I never thought much about what works well either; usually focused on failures instead...
Therapist: [Acknowledging softly without pressure] That's common when we're hard on ourselves—but seeing both successes alongside challenges lets us step toward a more balanced view over time.
Therapist: Let me suggest an experiment—would tracking positive cooking experiences help notice these hidden successes better? Does jotting these down sound manageable till next session together?
Client: [Hesitant nod yet considering potential option through reflective pause] Well yeah...could try seeing if little victories exist between mistakes—worth checking...
Therapist: [Warm validation expressing appreciation openly] I'm glad you're open-mindedly considering it! Exploring balance empowers discovering new possibilities despite setbacks—I'll be eager hearing about any positives discovered along way next week!
Client: [Conceding slightly reduced reservation finally settling neutral tone] Sure—I’ll give finding those positives shot before meeting again then!
Therapist: [Affectionate encouragement reinforcing shared intent] Wonderful approach embracing discovery process personally while working side-by-side gradually—Till next session then David—take care meantime: Remember extending grace yourself also pivotal during journey forward.
