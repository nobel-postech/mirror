## CBT Plan ##
1. Identify Catastrophic Thinking Patterns: We will start by examining the thoughts and beliefs that lead you to jump to the catastrophic conclusion that you will die alone without family or friends. We'll explore the situations or triggers that bring up these thoughts.
2. Challenge Negative Beliefs: Once we have identified these patterns, we will work on challenging the negative beliefs that contribute to your catastrophic thinking. We will look at evidence that supports and contradicts these beliefs to develop a more balanced perspective.
3. Reframe Thoughts: Together, we will practice reframing your thoughts into more realistic and balanced alternatives. For example, instead of "I will die alone without family or friends," we can reframe it as "I have people in my life who care about me, even if I enjoy solitude at times."
4. Behavioral Experiments: To test out these new perspectives, we may engage in behavioral experiments. These experiments will help you see the outcomes of challenging your catastrophic thoughts in real-life situations.
5. Gratitude Journal: I may suggest keeping a gratitude journal to help shift your focus from catastrophic thoughts to positive aspects of your life. This can help you appreciate the relationships and connections you have, reducing the feelings of loneliness and isolation.
