## CBT Plan ##
1. Identify Catastrophic Thinking Patterns: We will start by identifying when you engage in catastrophizing thoughts, such as labeling yourself as a terrible cook after making a mistake.
2. Challenge Negative Beliefs: Once we recognize these patterns, we will work on challenging the belief that one mistake defines your cooking skills. We will examine evidence that contradicts this belief and explore a more balanced perspective.
3. Reframing Techniques: We will practice reframing your thoughts about cooking. Instead of catastrophizing mistakes, we will work on reframing them as learning opportunities. For example, "I burnt the food this time, but I can improve by paying more attention next time."
4. Positive Experiences Journal: I may suggest keeping a journal of positive cooking experiences to help balance out the negative thoughts and challenge the tendency to engage in all-or-nothing thinking.
5. Behavioral Experiments: To test the validity of your negative beliefs, we may engage in behavioral experiments like trying out new recipes or cooking techniques. This will help build confidence and reshape your perception of your cooking skills.
