# **MIRROR**

This repository will provide the official code and dataset for our paper:
[🪞 MIRROR: Multimodal Cognitive Reframing Therapy for Rolling with Resistance](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.751/)

### ⭐ MIRROR Dataset Overview

**MIRROR** is a synthetic vision–language dataset designed to support **multimodal cognitive reframing** for client resistance.

To comply with the CelebA license, **the dataset does not include any images**.  
However, we provide the **full image synthesis pipeline**, enabling users to regenerate the edited facial expression images after downloading the original datasets from their official providers.

You can find the **full data synthesis pipeline** in the `mirror/` directory.

For detailed dataset documentation, please refer to the HuggingFace page:

### **🔧 Environment Setup**

After setting up the environment for the target VLM (Vision-Language Model),
please install the required packages for PhotoMaker by running:

```bash
pip install -r photomaker_requirements.txt
```

    abstract = "Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, which allows the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client{'}s negative emotional state.Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Mirror (Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs each client{'}s statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline vision language models (VLMs) so that they can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage client resistance.These models are then evaluated in terms of both their counseling skills as a therapist, and the strength of therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist{'}s ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.Human expert evaluations further confirm the effectiveness of our approach in managing client resistance and fostering therapeutic alliance."
