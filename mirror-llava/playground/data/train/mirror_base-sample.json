Tyler Reynolds is currently Single. No immediate family, lives alone.\n- Reason for Counseling: I decided to seek counseling as these negative beliefs were affecting my self-confidence and enjoyment of my hobbies.\n\nBelow is a conversation between the client and the psychotherapist.\nTherapist: That sounds tough to carry around. It seems like you're worried about how others perceive your passion for cars.\nClient: Yeah, it just feels like everyone thinks I should be doing something \"better\" with my time.\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way. But I'm curious—have you ever heard someone compliment your work or show interest in your hobby?\nClient: Well, a few friends said they liked what I've done, but... I don't know. It still feels like not everyone thinks it's cool.\nTherapist: It sounds like those compliments mean something, even if they’re not from everyone. What if we explored the idea that some people actually admire your dedication and craftsmanship?\nClient: Maybe... but it’s hard to believe that when I mostly think about the negative stuff.\n\nBased on their body language and facial expression, respond as a psychotherapist conducting a CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) session."
